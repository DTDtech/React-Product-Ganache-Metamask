This project uses Ganache and Metamask for blockchain and smart contract development. Firstly, connect to a Ganache account. Then, add a network manually on Metamask with the RPC 
Server and Network ID from the Ganache account. Then, use the solidity file "SlothCoin" from the SmartContract folder, compile and deploy it in Remix IDE using Injected Provider - 
Metamask. Finally, copy the deployed contract address and replace it with the contractAddress constant inside App.js. You're ready.
